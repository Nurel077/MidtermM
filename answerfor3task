What is the difference between switch and checkout?
Git switch and git checkout are both used to change branches, but they have some differences in syntax and behavior. Git switch is a newer command that is more focused on branches, 
while git checkout is an older command that can do other things besides switching branches.

What does git merge do?
Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command
 lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.


 What happens to the commit history after rebase and why?
 At its core, Git rebase is a command that helps you restructure your commit history. Instead of merging changes as they are, Git rebase integrates the commits from one branch onto another. This results in a cleaner, more linear commit history, making your project's history easier to understand and manage.


 How to understand which branch is remote and which is local in the terminal?

 To see all local branches, use:

bash
Копировать код
git branch
This will display a list of local branches. The current branch will be highlighted with an asterisk (*).

List Remote Branches
To see remote branches, you can use:

bash
Копировать код
git branch -r
This command lists all branches that are available on the remote repository.

List All Branches
If you want to see both local and remote branches together, you can use:

bash
Копировать код
git branch -a
This will show all local branches, along with remote branches prefixed by remotes/, like this:

bash
Копировать код
* branch-one
  branch-two
  remotes/origin/branch-three
  remotes/origin/branch-four
